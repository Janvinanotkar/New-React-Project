📌 Project Overview

In many organizations, managing employee tasks and tracking their progress is a common challenge.  
This project focuses on solving that problem by creating an **Employee and Admin Dashboard system**.

The **Admin** can create employees, assign tasks to them, and monitor how much work has been completed.  
The **Employees** can log in, view the tasks assigned to them, and track their task status.

This system helps improve transparency, task management, and productivity within an organization.
